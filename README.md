# Hangman

This is a web based port of the repository found [here](https://github.com/105ron/hang_man).

This app requires the use of session cookies to store the users game status (variables) between HTTP requests. As the client sends data to the server the information from the session cookies is loaded and executed by the Sinatra server then the HTML is assembled and sent to the clients browser along with the updated the users session cookies.

This is part of [TheOdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com) Rail's track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-project?ref=lc-pb) for more information.
